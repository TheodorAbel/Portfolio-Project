I am currently seeking my first internship opportunity, where I can apply my skills in coding and information systems while gaining hands-on experience in a professional environment.Beyond my academic pursuits, I am also a forex trader, focusing on gold trading, which has sharpened my analytical thinking, decision-making, and risk management skills.

            When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy playing basketball, socializing, and playing chess, which enhance my teamwork, interpersonal skills, and strategic thinking. My diverse interests and dedication to growth reflect my eagerness to contribute meaningfully to any project or team.
